# Unity-Prefab-Scraper

I made this script mostly to make importing ripped objects with scripts attached easier by telling you what files are attached to a prefab.
This python script scrapes a unity prefab, materials, and meta files to tell you what files are attached to a prefab.
Just download and place all the files in the proper folders, then run the script. (It should take 3-5 seconds for the first search of a prefab.)

If it breaks it's most likely due to me not writing a case where data doesn't exist in a prefab.
